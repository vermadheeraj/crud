# Configure IP allowlists

If your data source has firewall rules, it is vital to add IP addresses of Openblocks to the allowlist before connection. Then you can connect to databases or APIs and create queries.

## Allow IP addresses of Openblocks

Add the following IP addresses to your data source allowlist when needed:

```
54.149.191.117
54.71.67.239
```
